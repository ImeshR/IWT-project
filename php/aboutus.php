                <div class="ceo-message">
                    <p>I am delighted to share with you Sapphire Hotel's outstanding achievements in 2019. We surpassed our historic results from the previous year and, together with Sapphire Hotel, consolidated our position as international leaders in the
                        field. The solid foundations on which we've built Sapphire Hotel in recent years have allowed us to expand for another year, add value for an increasingly uncertain future, and ensure that we have the greatest teams and structure
                        to compete globally with greater certainty of success. We have an excellent and solvent operational and financial strategy that allowed us to grow revenues by 5.9% in 2019, to 0.5 billion dollars, and generate net income of 70
                        million dollars for the Parent Company, all while keeping a steady debt level and enough liquidity.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Furthermore, coordination with Sapphire Hotel has been optimal, resulting in significant strategic and business benefits all year. We have doubled the number of brands we operate as a result of the integration, and we have successfully
                        entered the premium segment. In short, we've become stronger and more nimble thanks to a hotel platform that now includes over 300 hotels in over 20 countries.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>With this in mind, we are ready to approach 2022 with zeal and a willingness to contribute to the creation of value for all those who have put their faith in our leadership. I am confident that we are on the right track to becoming
                        one of the world's most successful companies.
